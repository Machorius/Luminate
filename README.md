# Luminate
Move the obstacles and illuminate the level.

Luminate is a simple yet addictive strategy indie game made by self taught developer Machorius. This is his first public release of a game as he thought there would be nobody willing to play his creations. However, once encouraged by his best friend he decided to share his first project with the world. In the game "Luminate" there is a ball that drops from the top of the screen and you must move the obstacles in order for the ball to light them all up in a plinko-style level. This game only consists of four stages, however his first attempt took 23  minutes to complete. In this game there is no saving and continuing which makes it a perfect game for a speed-run. This game took him only 5 days to make using the open-source Godot engine. If any issues are encountered please add your trouble to a post on the issues tab. Pull requests are always welcome!
